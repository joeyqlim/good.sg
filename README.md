## Description
A microblog website where users can share their good deeds or behaviour (no matter how small), in an effort to cultivate a kind, civilized and considerate society. Built in Singapore, for Singapore, categories focus on public transport, public health, environment, charity, civic-mindedness and road safety.

Users must be signed in to make posts, and can upload their own avatar image. There are two types of users - regular users and administrators. Administrators are able to create new categories, access a dashboard of all users and have the power to remove or add administrator status for all users.

*Example posts:*
* "Today I returned my NTUC shopping trolley!"
* "This morning, I stepped out of the MRT to let other passengers alight."
